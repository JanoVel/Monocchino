Monocchino Arduino Theme
================

![screenshot]()

A dark Arduino theme inspired by both the Monokai theme (and its variants) and the Arduino/Genuino brand colors.

####INSTALLATION
Replace the `theme` folder found inside the `Arduino/lib` directory with the `theme` folder on this repository (the exact location may vary depending on your OS).

####MODIFYING THE THEME
Feel free to modify this theme to better fit your style!
The buttons must be edited and saved as GIFs, I used [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) to modify them. The Pixlr and PNG files of the images used can be found on the `image_files` folder of this repository.
Most of the editor and sytax colors can be modified by editing the `theme.txt` file. number colors are defined in the `default.xml` file within the `syntax` folder.
